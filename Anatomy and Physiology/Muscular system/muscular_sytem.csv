Question,Answer
What are the three types of muscle tissue?,"Skeletal muscle (striated, voluntary), cardiac muscle (striated, involuntary), smooth muscle (non-striated, involuntary)."
What are the five functions of muscle tissue?,"Produce body movements, stabilize body position, regulate organ volume, move substances within the body, produce heat."
What is the neuromuscular junction (NMJ)?,"The area where a motor neuron connects with a muscle fiber, responsible for transmitting nerve impulses to muscle cells."
What are the phases of a muscle twitch?,"Latent phase, contraction phase, relaxation phase."
What is muscle tone?,"A low level of continuous muscle contraction that maintains muscle health and prevents atrophy."
Define isometric and isotonic contractions.,"Isometric: muscle contracts without changing length; isotonic: muscle contracts with a change in length."
What is the role of ATP in muscle contraction?,"ATP is used for cross bridge formation, calcium reuptake, and sodium/potassium pump activity."
What are the three pathways for ATP production in muscles?,"Direct phosphorylation, anaerobic respiration, aerobic respiration."
What is muscle fatigue?,"The physiological inability of a muscle to contract despite the presence of a stimulus, caused by factors like ionic imbalances and decreased ATP."
What are the functions of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)?,"The SR regulates calcium ion concentration within the muscle cell and stores and releases calcium ions."
What are the events at the neuromuscular junction?,"Action potential arrives, calcium enters the neuron, ACh is released, ACh binds to the muscle fiber, leading to muscle excitation."
What is cross bridge formation?,"The process where myosin heads bind to actin, pulling the filaments toward the M-line, causing muscle contraction."
Define muscle hypertrophy.,"An increase in muscle size due to resistance training, where muscle fibers grow in size by increasing myofilaments."
What is the sliding filament theory?,"A theory that explains how muscles contract by myosin heads pulling actin filaments, causing the sarcomere to shorten."
What is the difference between slow oxidative and fast glycolytic muscle fibers?,"Slow oxidative: aerobic, fatigue-resistant, used for endurance; fast glycolytic: anaerobic, fatigues quickly, used for short bursts of power."
What are the origins and insertions of muscles?,"Origin: attachment to the immovable bone; Insertion: attachment to the movable bone."
